# Morse Code Printer

Python app that prints messages in morse code to an attached thermal printer. Uses the keyboard library to listen for keyboard inputs, stores them in a buffer that is displayed on a 16x2 LED screen and then translates the buffer to morse code and sends it to the printer when the user hits 'enter'
